The application connects to a MySQL DB according to the information configured in the "connectionString.txt" file (if the file is missing, the default hard-coded DB name, IP address, user and password are used).

The application will check to see if the needed tables are located in the DB and if not, they will be created.

The user will be able to load files containing Twitter tweets into the DB and then run searches on them according to different parameters.

Word pairs, groups and expressions may be added to the DB for future reference and search. The DB may be exported for backup purposes to an XML file. Exported backup XML files may be used for restoration of the DB.

This is my final Database course project, and it is written in Java and SQL.
